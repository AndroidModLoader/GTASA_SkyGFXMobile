SkyGFX is a graphical mod which reimplements PS2 rendering or atleast tries to.
This version is __not an official port of a PC version__. Most likely, the original author TheHero a.k.a. aap doesn't even know about it.
As a mobile version, it tries to bring back an atmosphere of PS2 and some missing effects that were cut during the porting.
As a bonus, it's improving the game visuals.
